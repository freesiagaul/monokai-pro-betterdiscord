# Monokai Pro Theme

Designed for use with BetterDiscord. 

This theme was inspired by the BetterDiscord Midnight theme and Monokai Pro VSCode theme. It was created so my IDE and Discord looked the same but found others wanted to use it. It's designed to make minimal changes and could be improved a lot, so play around with the CSS if you want it to be cooler.
